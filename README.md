# AB-Testing-eCommerce-Website

A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a process of showing two variants of the same web page to different segments of website visitors at the same time and comparing which variant drives more conversions. This project uses statistical analysis (simulation methods, confidence intervals for hypotheis testing) to help evaluate whether a variation in the webpage has any significant impact on the number of conversions.
